(From Bruno)

Run Python REPL in Flask Shell (run from top level git project directory, same as README.md):
- Windows:  
set FLASK_APP=twitoff:APP
python -m flask shell

- Unix/Mac
FLASK_APP=twitoff:APP flask shell

To run the Flask App - Same steps as above but replace 'shell' with 'run' 

To add users to the database:
- Go to Python REPL following the commands above.
- Execute the following commands:
from twitoff.models import *
DB                   # confirm location
DB.create_all()      # only need to run one time to create tables

Optional: If you'd like you can open the table in DB Browser to confirm the Users and Tweet tables have been properly created. Make sure to close DB Browser before you add users!

u1 = User(id=1, username='austen')
t1 = Tweet(id=1, text='Lambda School Rocks!')

# Only need to do this for new entities, not to edit existing users/tweets
DB.session.add(u1)
DB.session.add(t1)
DB.session.commit()

# To Query the database from the flask shell REPL
User.query.all()
User.query.all()[0].username
Tweets.query.all()[0].text
